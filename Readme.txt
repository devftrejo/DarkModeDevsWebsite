This project is a personal/professional portfolio website built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with the Bootstrap framework, third-party libraries, and FormSubmit. It uses npm package management, and lite-server for the development process with VSCode as my IDE. Lastly, it is hosted on Vercel.

To run a development server:
1. git pull
2. npm i
3. npm start
